<h2>Adrian Toomes/Green Vulture</h2>

<p>Utilizing his Green Vulture harness, Adrian Toomes is able to fly as if by natural winged flight. He wears a green costume of synthetic stretch fabric housing a tailored electromagnetic harness with artificial bird-like wings attached beneath the arms. This consists of an green electromagnetic anti-graviton generator worn on his body as a harness, enabling him to fly silently with precise maneuverability. The Green Vulture harness also increases his resistance to injury to the point that he can survive blows from Spider-Man's enhanced strength. Another by-product of his exposure to the harness is that, despite his age and lack of exercise, Toomes' physical strength represents the upper limits of human development. When he removes the harness, some of his enhanced abilities slowly fade, although the rate at which this transpires remains unclear. Toomes is elderly and depends on his green electromagnetic harness to augment his strength, vitality, and athletic prowess, as well as absorbing life force to maintain his vitality. It has recently been revealed that, due to his prolonged use of the harness, Toomes can levitate or float his body even without the harness, although he requires his green wings to maneuver while airborne. Toomes has a new version of his green Vulture flight harness that has supposedly been augmented by the Green Goblin. Though he claimed that it increased his strength by 500%, it appeared to be a bluff to frighten the Black Cat, who proceeded to beat him half to death. Toomes is intellectually brilliant in the fields of electronics and mechanical engineering, with a great talent for invention. He has earned a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering.</p>
